# George Eliot Archive - Relationship Web

The _George Eliot Archive_ features an interactive relationship web,
in which the novelist's relations with friends, family, and business associates are visualized.
Significant relationships are displayed as larger and physically closer to George Eliot,
while lesser relations are smaller and placed further away.
Brief biographical summaries based on _The Oxford Reader's Companion to George Eliot_ (edited by John Rignall)
are featured for more than 150 individuals who were connected to George Eliot.
The _George Eliot Archive_ team thanks Dr. John Rignall, an expert consultant for the biographical summaries.

The relationship web is created using JavaScript with the D3.js library.
