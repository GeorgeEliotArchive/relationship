# George Eliot's Social Network (Relationship Web)  

The _George Eliot Archive_ features an interactive relationship web (or Social Network)
in which the novelist's relations with friends and family members are visualized. 
Significant relationships are displayed as larger and physically closer to George Eliot, 
while lesser relations are smaller and placed further away. 
Brief biographical summaries based on _The Oxford Reader's Companion to George Eliot_ (edited by John Rignall) 
are featured for more than 150 individuals who were connected to George Eliot. 
These biographical summaries were written by several _George Eliot Archive_ team members 2019-2021 with Dr Beverley Rilett. 
The team thanks Dr. John Rignall, an expert consultant, for a final editorial review. 

The relationship web is created using JavaScript with the D3.js library.
