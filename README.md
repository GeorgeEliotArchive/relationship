# George Eliot's Social Network (Relationship Web) 
https://georgeeliotarchive.org/relationships


The _George Eliot Archive_ features an interactive tool for visualizing George Eliot's friends and relations--her social network.

### Project Description:

- **Interactive Visualization Tool**: Displays George Eliot's social network, with significant relationships appearing larger and closer to her, and lesser ones smaller and farther away.  
- **Biographical Summaries**: Click on any of the 125 thumbnail portraits to access brief summaries of their relationship with George Eliot, written by class and team members (2019â€“2021) under Dr. Beverley Rilett. These are based on _The Oxford Reader's Companion to George Eliot_ (edited by John Rignall), who also reviewed and provided editorial suggestions.  
- **Letters Index**: Includes references to letters written to/from George Eliot, as indexed in _The George Eliot Letters_ (edited by Gordon S. Haight). Rachel Gordon edited the project's index of letters.  
- **Expert Contributions**: Additional editorial review provided by John Rignall, Kathleen McCormack, Brenda MacKay, Robert Muscutt, and Beverley Rilett.  
- **Data Visualization Development**:  
  - Initial coding by Riley Ji (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) using JavaScript and D3.js.  
  - Updates and revisions by Brad Hughes and Libo Sun (Auburn University) since 2021.  
- **Ongoing Project**: Many more relationships will be added as this project continues to evolve with new updates and features.
