# George Eliot's Social Network (Relationship Web) 
https://georgeeliotarchive.org/relationships


The _George Eliot Archive_ features an interactive tool for visualizing George Eliot's friends and relations--her social network.

Significant relationships are displayed as larger and physically closer to George Eliot, 
while lesser relations are smaller and placed further away. 
Click on any of the 125 thumbnail portraits to read brief biographical summaries of their relationship with George Eliot.
Below the summaries is an index to letters written to or fom George Eliot as they appear in the George Eliot Letters edited by Gordon S. Haight, showing volume and page number. 
These biographical summaries were written by several _George Eliot Archive_ team members 2019-2021 with Dr Beverley Rilett. 
Summaries condense information from longer biographical essays collected in based on _The Oxford Reader's Companion to George Eliot_ edited by John Rignall. 
The team thanks Dr. Rignall for reviewing our summaries and his numerous editorial suggestions prior to the launch of this application.
Thank you to other expert advisors as well, including Kathleen McCormack, Brenda MacKay, and Robert Muscutt for additional editorial collaboration.
Rachel Gordon edited the letters index. 

The data visualization is created using JavaScript with the D3.js library. It was first created by a brilliant undergraduate computer science student,Riley Ji, at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
This project continues to evolve. The coding was revised and updated since 2021 by Brad Hughes, and later Libo Sun at Auburn University.
