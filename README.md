# George Eliot's Social Network (Relationship Web)  

The _George Eliot Archive_ features an interactive tool for visualizing George Eliot's friends and relations--her social network.

Significant relationships are displayed as larger and physically closer to George Eliot, 
while lesser relations are smaller and placed further away. 
Click on any of the 125 thumbnail portraits to read brief biographical summaries of their relationship with George Eliot.

These biographical summaries were written by several _George Eliot Archive_ team members 2019-2021 with Dr Beverley Rilett. 
Summaries condense information from longer biographical essays collected in based on _The Oxford Reader's Companion to George Eliot_ edited by John Rignall. 
The team thanks Dr. Rignall for reviewing our summaries and his numerous editorial suggestions prior to the launch of this application.
Thank you to other expert advisors as well, including Kathleen McCormack, Brenda MacKay, and Robert Muscutt for additional editorial collaboration.

The data visualization is created using JavaScript with the D3.js library. It was first created by Riley Ji, as an undergraduate computer science major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. It has been revised and updated since 2021 by Brad Hughes and Libo Sun at Auburn University.
