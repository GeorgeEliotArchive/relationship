"Call, Wathen Mark Wilks (1817 -- 1890)","Wathen Mark Wilks Call, or Mark, was the second husband of one of George Eliot's closest longtime friends, Elizabeth Rebecca 'Rufa' Brabant. Call married Rufa, the widow of Charles Christian Hennell, in 1857.","8:304, 8:308"
"Chapman, Susanna Brewitt","<p>Susanna Chapman was the wife of John Chapman; John was publisher of the <em>Westminster Review</em>, where George Eliot was the de facto editor from 1851-54. Susanna Chapman ran a boarding house where many writers for the journal lived, including George Eliot.&nbsp;<br /><br />Susanna was older than John by fourteen years and much wealthier. Her inheritance from her lace manufacturing father allowed John to purchase properties and businesses after they moved to London. His poor money management skills strained the marriage.</p>
<p>Susanna Chapman bore four children, though one died in infancy and another with special needs was adopted by Susanna's brother. &nbsp;<br /><br />John Chapman and George Eliot may have been lovers while she was living in their boarding house, according to <span>biographer Gordon Haight, who gleaned suggestive evidence from John Chapman's diary. The</span>&nbsp;diary showed that the Chapmans' nanny was also having an affair with John. Eventually, after spending many years living with John and his mistress(es), Susanna separated from him in 1874. He left for Paris to practice medicine, while Susanna continued to raise their children in England.</p>",4:486 8:52
"Evans, Samuel (1777 - 1858)","Samuel Evans was George Eliot's uncle, her father Robert's younger brother. He was a Methodist convert who was a model for the character of Seth Bede in Eliot's first novel, <em>Adam Bede</em>. Samuel Evans was the husband of Elizabeth Evans, a female preacher and the model for Dinah.",
"Cash, Mary Sibree","Mary Sibree, later Mary Cash, was a friend, pupil, and correspondent of George Eliot's. The two remained friends for years, since their first meeting in Foleshill (Coventry) in 1841. Sibree provided details of Eliot's life in Foleshill to John Walter Cross, including the only first-hand account that exists of Eliot's loss of faith, recalling how deeply Eliot was moved.","2:343 4:108, 4:437 5:385 6:361 8:10, 8:10, 8:10, 8:11, 8:11, 8:12, 8:15, 8:467"
"Evans, Harriet (d. 1809)","Harriet Evans was the first wife of George Eliot's father, Robert Evans. Born Harriet Poynton, she was the favored attendant of Lady Newdigate of the Arbury Hall estate, where the Evans family lived and worked. Harriet bore two children, Robert and Frances 'Fanny,' elder half-siblings to George Eliot. Harriet Evans died in childbirth in 1809.",
"Harrison, Ethel Bertha (1851-1916)","Ethel Harrison was the wife and cousin of Frederic Harrison. The two married in 1870. She does not appear to have corresponded with George Eliot directly, though she and Frederic write about Eliot in surviving correspondence to each other.","5:263, 5:331, 5:341 7:129, 7:151"
"Call, Elizabeth Rebecca [nee Brabant]
","Elizabeth Rebecca 'Rufa' Hennell Call [n√©e Brabant] was one of George Eliot's earliest and most enduring friends, though little of their correspondence has survived. Eliot did not like her initially, but admitted to Sara Hennell, Rufa's sister-in-law, eventually that her first impression of Rufa Brabant was not fair and that Rufa's 'tender seriousness' and other qualities made her 'almost worthy of Mr. Hennell.' Eliot was a bridesmaid in Rufa's wedding to Charles Hennell. After Hennell's death, Rufa married Mark Call in 1857.","2:475 4:268 8:308, 8:431"
"Cross, Eleanor (1847 - 1895)","Eleanor Cross was the sister of John Cross, who became George Eliot's husband in 1880. Eliot was a friend and mentor to Eleanor several years before the women became sisters-in-law. &nbsp;Eleanor (and John) lived with their mother and nursed her through her fatal illness in 1878. Following George Eliot's sudden death in 1880, Eleanor again moved in with her brother John.","7:256, 7:259, 7:260, 7:266, 7:273, 7:296, 7:336, 7:337"
"Helps, Alice","Alice Helps was the eldest daughter of Sir Arthur Helps, who was a lifelong friend of Eliot's partner, G. H. Lewes. For the first five years of Eliot's 'marriage' to Lewes, he spent part of his holidays with the Helps family, but George Eliot was not invited. After Eliot became a famous novelist, many people who once shunned her warmed considerably. Alice Helps came to view George Eliot as a maternal figure and friend.","5:398 6:32, 6:35, 6:129, 6:149, 6:194 7:310"
"Bray, Caroline Cara' Hennell (1814-1905)'","<p>Caroline 'Cara' Hennell Bray was one of George Eliot's dearest friends. When Eliot met her in 1841, she was already in her fifth year of marriage to Charles Bray. Eliot met the couple when she and her father moved to Coventry, and the group grew close rapidly. Eliot, Cara, and Sara Hennell (Cara's sister) became lifelong friends, forming a sisterly bond and supporting one another in their broad-ranging studies and writing. <span>The Brays' influence may have led Eliot to question her religious faith.&nbsp;</span>Especially during her religious disagreements with her father, Eliot found a second home at Rosehill,the name of the Brays' estate.</p>
<p>Even after she moved to London to become a journalist and editor, Eliot remained close to the Brays and Sara, writing them long letters and frequently spending holidays with them. Though they disliked Lewes, and rarely visited after 1854, the friendship continued to Eliot's last days.<br /><br />Cara and Charles Bray seem to have had marital problems or had chosen to have an unconventional marriage; Cara found love with Edward Noel, and Charles bore six children with another woman, one of which Cara accepted into her home as if she were her own child. Evidence of the Brays' complicated marital situation makes even more curious their sanctimonious response to Eliot's illicit relationship with George Henry Lewes. After six years of separation and few letters, Cara and Marian were reunited in 1859, at which time Marian revealed she was George Eliot, the now-famous author of <em>Adam Bede</em>. Eliot encouraged Cara to author several works of her own. When Eliot married John Cross, Cara gave her blessing. She was left a sum of money in Eliot's will.</p>","To: 1:267, 1:284, 1:291, 1:295, 1:321, 1:329, 1:336, 1:341, 1:346, 1:363, 1:371, 1:373, 1:374, 1:376, 1:377, 2:3, 2:9, 2:10, 2:12, 2:15, 2:16, 2:20, 2:22, 2:23, 2:25, 2:27, 2:29, 2:31, 2:32, 2:34, 2:36, 2:41, 2:42, 2:51, 2:55, 2:58, 2:59, 2:60, 2:65, 2:66, 2:67, 2:68, 2:69, 2:74, 2:75, 2:81, 2:84, 2:87, 2:88, 2:89, 2:90, 2:92, 2:96, 2:97, 2:99, 2:100, 2:102, 2:103, 2:111, 2:114, 2:116, 2:117, 2:119, 2:129, 2:135, 2:149, 2:150, 2:155, 2:160, 2:162, 2:163, 2:166, 2:213, 2:217, 2:313, 2:338, 2:397, 2:443, 2:500, 3:19, 3:22, 3:29, 3:32, 3:37, 3:99, 3:122, 3:137, 3:170, 3:321, 3:344, 3:345, 3:436, 3:456, 4:7, 4:10, 4:32, 4:33, 4:87, 4:106, 4:107. 4:113, 4:120, 4:124, 4:136, 4:148, 4:182, 4:194, 4:197, 4:207, 4:267, 4:326, 4:355, 4:356, 4:374, 4:397, 4:404, 4:421, 4:438, 4:477, 4:490, 5:44, 5:46, 5:50, 5:52, 5:54, 5:60, 5:114, 5:136, 5:138, 5:169. 5:173, 5:197, 5:266, 5:383, 5:389, 5:394, 5:418, 5:432, 5:435, 5:443, 5:471, 6:18, 6:32, 6:52, 6:94, 6:95, 6:118, 6:220, 6:283, 6:319, 6:352, 6:425, 7:29, 7:37, 7:40, 7:61, 7:123, 7:189, 7:340, 8:199, 8:276, 8:308, 8:458, 9:153<br /><br />From: 1:180, 1:184, 5:394, 5:395, 7:275, 7:299, 8:119, 8:248<br /><br />About: 1:214, 1:223, 1:224, 1:225, 1:235, 1:236, 1:238, 1:240, 1:241, 1:244, 1:264, 1:268, 1:271, 1:281, 1:303, 1:308, 1:310, 1:316, 1:318, 1:320, 1:324, 1:357, 1:365, 1:367, 3:16, 3:26, 3:53, 3:68, 3:71, 3:87, 3:91, 3:96, 3:141, 3:229, 3:311, 3:316, 3:324, 3:328, 3:338, 3:359, 3:377, 3:382, 3:391, 3:405, 3:429, 3:433, 3:439, 3:445, 3:452, 3:469, 4:12, 4:49, 4:72, 4:75, 4:82, 4:89, 4:90, 4:93, 4:105, 4:109, 4:128, 4:135, 4:138, 4:144, 4:145, 4:147, 4:153, 4:173, 4:177, 4:180, 4:193, 4:206, 4:235, 4:269, 4:297, 4:360, 4:363, 4:371, 4:401, 4:424, 4:488, 9:102"
"Blackwood, John (1818-1879)","John Blackwood was editor of <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, known as 'Maga,' the magazine in which George Eliot first published. Blackwood at first dealt exclusively with George Henry Lewes to publish Eliot's works. Eventually, after he had nurtured a supportive relationship as publisher of Eliot's first works of fiction, <i>Scenes of Clerical Life </i>and <i>Adam Bede</i>, Eliot revealed her identity to Blackwood. Even after Eliot moved on to publish <i>Romola </i>with George Smith, who offered much higher payment than Blackwood could afford, Blackwood remained friendly. After a somewhat disappointing reception to <i>Romola</i>, Eliot returned to Blackwood to publish all her later works, including <i>Middlemarch</i>.","2:269, 2:272, 2:273, 2:275, 2:276, 2:281, 2:283, 2:290, 2:293, 2:294, 2:296, 2:297, 2:298, 2:298, 2:299, 2:300, 2:302 ,2:303, 2:307, 2:307, 2:308, 2:309, 2:316, 2:321, 2:321, 2:323, 2:323, 2:324, 2:325, 2:325, 2:328, 2:330, 2:334, 2:337, 2:338, 2:344, 2:347, 2:350, 2:352, 2:353, 2:359, 2:359, 2:361, 2:363, 2:365, 2:370, 2:371, 2:372, 2:373, 3:373, 2:374, 2:374, 2:375, 2:378, 2:380, 2:381, 2:385, 2:386, 2:386, 2:387, 2:393, 2:394, 2:395, 2:399, 2:399, 2:405, 2:410, 2:411, 2:413, 2:413, 2:416, 2:417, 2:418, 2:424, 2:427, 2:429, 2:430, 2:432, 2:433, 2:433, 2:435, 2:436, 2:439, 2:442, 2:444, 2:446, 2:448, 2:448, 2:456, 2:459, 2:461, 2:462, 2:463, 2:466, 2:466, 2:468, 2:473, 2:479, 2:480, 2:480, 2:481, 2:482, 2:483, 2:485, 2:487, 2:491, 2:492, 2:493, 2:494, 2:496, 2:497, 2:498, 2:499, 2:499, 2:505, 2:506, 2:507, 2:508, 2:509, 2:509, 2:512, 2:513,

"Brabant, Robert Herbert (1781-1866)","Dr. Robert Brabant was a physician and the father of one of George Eliot‚Äôs good friends, Elizabeth&nbsp; Rebecca Brabant, who was usually called ‚ÄúRufa.‚Äù Dr. Brabant met Eliot in 1843, when she was a bridesmaid in Rufa‚Äôs and Charles Hennell‚Äôs wedding. Immediately after, Dr. Brabant invited Eliot to stay with him and his wife at Devries for a few months ‚Äúto fill the place of his daughter‚Äù (Haight, <em>GE</em>, 49). <br /><br />George Eliot deeply admired Brabant, who spoke to her as an intellectual equal and began mentoring her in German during her extended visit. She warmly described her living arrangements in letters to friends until she was unexpectedly asked to leave. Apparently, Brabant‚Äôs wife had become suspicious of the inappropriate closeness developing between her husband and the appreciative young woman. <br /><br />After Eliot moved to London in 1851, Brabant became a regular visitor who sometimes escorted her to the theater. Some of Eliot‚Äôs letters describe displeasure with Brabant‚Äôs presence at this time and mock him. After Eliot began living with George Henry Lewes in 1854, she and Brabant lost touch. Gordon Haight and several other critics believe Brabant to be the primary inspiration for Eliot‚Äôs character Casaubon in <em>Middlemarch</em>.",
"Bray, Charles (1811-1894)","Charles Bray, married to Caroline 'Cara' Hennell, was a ribbon manufacturer in Coventry. Bray's circle of friends welcomed George Eliot in 1841 and Bray became a close friend in the years after. Perhaps one of Bray's draws for Eliot was his philanthropic nature; Bray set up help for out-of-work ribbon workers, along with several other charitable attempts aimed at relieving poverty. <br /><br />Bray was the owner of the <em>Coventry Herald</em> and <em>Observer</em>, which gave Eliot her first opportunity to publish her writing. Bray himself published several works, along with <em>Philosophy of Necessity</em>, which asserted that the laws of the mind were set. This system appealed to Eliot, who found intellectual stimulus among Bray's circle of friends. She stayed so often with the couple that Rosehill was like a second home to her.&nbsp;<br /><br />Bray had an extended affair with Hannah Steane, who bore six children with Bray. It is not certain if Eliot was aware of the Brays‚Äô unusual marital situation. Charles Bray was one of the first Eliot confided in about her relationship with Lewes (though, notably, she did not confide in Cara). For several years after Eliot began living with Lewes, her relationship with the Brays grew distant; they disliked Lewes and the couple never visited Rosehill together, though it had been Eliot‚Äôs home-away-from-home for many years. Later, financial setbacks forced the Brays to leave their Rosehill estate and move to more modest housing. Eventually, the Brays reunited with Eliot and they remained fast friends until her death.","2:6, 2:8, 2:9, 2:11, 2:14, 2:17, 2:20, 2:20, 2:22, 2:23, 2:26, 2:27, 2:31, 2:32, 2:34, 2:36, 2:37, 2:38, 2:42, 2:43, 2:46, 2:50, 2:56, 2:58, 2:59, 2:60, 2:65, 2:67, 2:68, 2:69, 2:71, 2:71, 2:73, 2:73, 2:74, 2:75, 2:79, 2:79, 2:81, 2:82, 2:83, 2:83, 2:84, 2:88, 2:89, 2:90, 2:92, 2:93, 2:94, 2:96, 2:99, 2:99, 2:100, 2:101, 2:113, 2:116, 2:116, 2:117, 2:121, 2:122, 2:123, 2:125, 2:131, 2:136, 2:139, 2:158, 2:161, 2:165, 2:170, 2:178, 2:183, 2:184, 2:188, 2:197, 2:199, 2:200, 2:201, 2:202, 2:204, 2:209, 2:215, 2:218, 2:221, 2:224, 2:232, 2:234, 2:252, 2:260, 2:261, 2:262, 2:267, 2:279, 2:279, 2:284, 2:287, 2:396, 2:402, 2:414, 2:510

In 1850, the two men co-founded a weekly newspaper, the <i>Leader</i>, to which George Eliot later contributed articles, often as substitutes for ones Lewes was slated to write. Lewes's wife Agnes had a prolonged affair with Thornton Hunt, which resulted in four children. Lewes had full knowledge of the affair with Hunt, who was also married; in fact, Lewes gave the children his name and even registered two of Hunt's children as his own, which effectively condoned the affair. George and Agnes Lewes separated but never sought a divorce. Though Lewes and Hunt had disagreed about which of them should support Agnes and the children, Lewes continued to send them money before and after Hunt's death in 1873.",
"Huxley, Thomas Henry (1825-1895)","<p>Thomas Henry Huxley upset George Eliot greatly while she was working on the <i>Westminster Review</i> by submitting a hostile review of George Henry Lewes‚Äôs translation of Comte‚Äòs <i> Philosophy of the Sciences</i>. Huxley accused Lewes of being an amateur, having only ‚Äùbook knowledge‚Äù of scientific subjects and no experience with experimentation. Eliot tried to have the article omitted or altered, but failed. Huxley coined the term ‚Äúagnostic‚Äù to describe his own position regarding religion, which closely corresponded with Eliot‚Äôs views.</p>
<p>The relationship between Lewes and Huxley improved over the years, to the point where Huxley was appointed one of the trustees of the George Henry Lewes Studentship at Cambridge following Lewes‚Äôs death. Surprisingly, upon Eliot‚Äôs death, Huxley opposed the petition to bury George Eliot in Westminster Abbey's Poet's Corner.

<p>Not only was he an admirer of Eliot's works, Jowett was also a close and trusted friend. In 1879, following Lewes's death, Jowett wrote a letter of condolence in which he urged her to keep writing and that she must not abandon what was 'a precious trust.'

He asked in 1860 if he could draw George Eliot‚Äôs head and shoulders. She initially put him off but Lewes agreed she would do it after they returned from a trip abroad. Laurence asked for six sittings, which exhausted Eliot. By August 28th, 1860, she had had enough and refused additional sittings. After initially giving Laurence permission to exhibit the portrait in the Royal Academy, Lewes later rescinded, requesting that it not be shared beyond the doors of Laurence's own studio. This fallout has not been adequately explained by biographers. Laurence's portrait of George Eliot was not exhibited; in June of 1861, Eliot's publisher, John Blackwood, purchased the portrait, where for many years it hung in the back parlor of his office in George Street, Edinburgh.

Agnes was raised in a radical, literary household where she was well educated by her father and tutors. Lewes may have been one of her tutors. Agnes later helped Lewes with a number of the articles and reviews he submitted to periodicals. Agnes gave birth to five children by Lewes, three of whom survived past infancy: Charles Lee Lewes, Thornton Arnott Lewes, and Herbert Arthur Lewes. By 1849, Agnes had begun a relationship affair with Lewes's close friend and business partner Thornton Leigh Hunt, which would result in four children. Despite the affair, which Lewes had full knowledge of, Lewes and Agnes continued to live together for several years. Lewes registered the first two of Agnes and Hunt's children as his own and all four carried his name, which made filing for divorce from Agnes on the grounds of her adultery problematic.</p>
<p>Whether Lewes left Agnes in 1852, ‚Äò53, or ‚Äò54 remains uncertain; Herbert Spencer reported many years later that Lewes had been separated from Agnes for two years before he began living with Eliot, however letters from Lewes were addressed from his home with Agnes into 1854. Even after Lewes left Agnes and began his relationship with Eliot, he spent at least one Christmas holiday with the family instead of with Eliot.

After attending school in Switzerland, Charles returned to England to live with his father and George Eliot in 1860. He remained living with them as he took the Civil Service Exams and, with the help of Anthony Trollope, received a job at the Post Office. <br /><br />In 1865, Charles married Gertrude Hill. He became both an important business partner and a source of emotional support to George Eliot after George Henry Lewes's death in 1878. He also supported Eliot's marriage to John Cross in 1880. In fact, Charles walked his step-mother down the aisle. <br /><br />Upon Eliot‚Äôs death, Charles was named the sole executor of her will. Charles was an industrious man in his life and his accomplishments ranged from writing translations, campaigning, and becoming one of the first members of the Greater London Council. Charles died in 1891 in Egypt after his doctor sent him away from the British climate.","3:125, 3:177, 3:215, 3:242, 3:273, 3:407, 3:408, 3:411, 3:413, 3:418, 3:421, 3:451, 4:20, 4:26, 4:29, 4:31, 4:36, 4:53, 4:54, 4:76, 4:90, 4:150, 4:151, 4:163, 4:185, 4:272, 4:281, 4:283, 4:331, 4:345, 4:383, 4:387, 4:420, 4:454, 4:478, 5:36, 5:72, 5:85, 5:91, 5:96, 5:110, 5:126, 5:135, 5:143, 5:149, 5:154, 5:161, 5:176, 5:180, 5:278, 5:316, 5:423, 5:424, 6:59, 6:77, 6:153, 6:184, 6:264, 6:267, 7:38, 7:64, 7:73, 7:84, 7:87, 7:88, 7:90, 7:106, 7:143, 7:156, 7:158, 7:161, 7:167, 7:175, 7:177, 7:178, 7:179, 7:184, 7:187, 7:190, 7:193, 7:201, 7:205, 7:213, 7:216, 7:217, 7:222, 7:224, 7:276, 7:282, 7:288, 7:293, 7:302, 7:304, 7:306, 7:311, , 7:318, 7:318, 7:325, 7:327, 7:329, 7:338, 8:120, 8:164, 8:174, 8:190, 8:282, 8:451 "
"Lewes, Elizabeth Ashweek Willim (1787-1870)","Elizabeth Ashweek Willim Lewes was the mother of George Henry Lewes. George Henry Lewes's father, John Lee Lewes, left the mother of four of his children (born between 1803 and 1808) to live with Elizabeth Ashweek in 1811. Together, they had 3 sons: Edgar James, Edward Charles, and George Henry Lewes. John Lee Lewes left the family around 1819 when George Henry was about 2 years old; (he died in 1831). Ashweek remarried in 1823 to a retired East India Company, Captain John Gurens Willim.&nbsp;<span>The family, long plagued by money troubles and housing insecurity, finally was well supported by George Henry Lewes&nbsp;late in her life, thanks to George Eliot's success as an author.</span>",0.355555556
"Lewes, George Henry (1817-1878)","A productive writer and critic, George Henry Lewes lived with George Eliot from 1854 until his death in 1878. Though little is known of his childhood, Lewes appears to have grown up plagued with financial problems and an unstable family unit. He found work as a clerk, and eventually attempted to break into the literary scene with a biography of Percy Bysshe Shelley. After meeting Shelley's friend Leigh Hunt, he hoped to forge a personal connection with Shelley's widow, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. Unfortunately for Lewes, Shelley's widow would not support the proposed biography. While the biography did not come to fruition, Leigh Hunt and his son Thornton Hunt remained a part of Lewes's life. <br /><br />Lewes's wife, Agnes, birthed three children to Lewes (Charles, Thornton, and Herbert), but by the late 1840s, their domestic relationship was withering. Because of his own beliefs in free sexual relations, probably borrowed from Shelley, Lewes allowed and perhaps even approved when Thornton Hunt began a sexual relationship with Agnes, which produced the first of four children in 1850. Lewes signed his name to the birth certificates for even Hunt's children, which made divorce options complicated if not impossible later on. <br /><br />While Lewes became successful in his writing endeavors, he fell into a great depression because of his domestic life. Even as he garnered praise for his works, including his popular <i>A Biographical History of Philosophy</i> and his many articles written for various magazines, Lewes did not recover from his depression until he met George Eliot through a common friend, Herbert Spencer. The two became lovers, perhaps as early as 1853, and by July 1854, when Lewes and Eliot traveled to Germany together and stayed on the continent for nearly 8 months, they had established themselves as a couple. Lewes went to Germany to conduct research for his <em>Life of Goethe</em>, while Eliot ostensibly joined him to provide German-to-English translation assistance. As it turned out, Lewes's <em>Life of Goethe</em>, which never mentions Eliot, not only enjoyed several reprintings during Lewes's lifetime but also was his most successful work. Lewes turned to more scientific articles after his Goethe biography, including a series of articles (later collected in book form) on marine life written while he and Eliot travelled to the English and Welsh coasts. Lewes sent his two elder sons to boarding school on the continent, possibly to save them from the gossip that plagued Lewes and Eliot in England. It took Lewes three years to reveal to his sons the fact of his relationship with Eliot. Thrilled to learn she was the celebrity author of <i>Adam Bede</i>, the boys accepted her and eventually would call her 'Mutter.'<br /><br />It was Lewes's support that encouraged Eliot to begin writing fiction. From the beginning, Lewes acted as an intermediary between Eliot and her publishers. While their relationship undoubtedly was vital in motivating George Eliot, some critics question Lewes's methods of isolating her from negative feedback. However, Lewes evidently found pleasure rather than jealousy in her success and wrote adoringly of her in letters to friends. <br /><br />In his later years, Lewes became editor to several important magazines, including the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> in 1862 and the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> in 1865. Two of his children moved to Africa in this period to farm, though his son Thornton, 'Thornie,' moved back in 1869 after contracting spinal meningitis. Lewes and Eliot nursed him until his death in that year. Herbert, 'Bertie,' his youngest son died also, of tuberculosis, in Africa before he could return to England. At the end of his life, Lewes strove to complete his 5-volume magnum opus, <i>Problems of Life and Mind,</i> that combined physiology and psychology. The final two volumes would have remained unfinished had Eliot not picked up the pen after Lewes's death. Lewes was praised posthumously by many of his contemporaries for his long, successful life as a writer.","2:139, 2:176, 2:269, 2:272, 2:273, 2:275, 2:276, 2:281, 2:294, 2:296, 2:296, 2:299, 2:307,

"Lewes, Herbert Bertie"" Arthur (1846-1875)""","The youngest son of George Henry Lewes, Herbert 'Bertie' Lewes attended school in Switzerland in 1857, a year after his brothers set out to the same school. He returned to practice farming in Scotland before following his brother Thornton, 'Thornie,' to Natal, Africa, to farm. In 1869, Thornie returned to England with fatal spinal meningitis, but Bertie continued to eke out a living in Natal. In 1871, Bertie married&nbsp;<span>Eliza Harrison, </span>the daughter of another Englishman, and the couple had two children, George and Marian. Shortly after the birth of George, in 1875, Bertie died of tuberculosis, which he contracted while living in Africa.","8:252, 8:491 "
"Lewes, Thornton Thornie"" Arnott (1844-1869)""","<p>Thornton 'Thornie' Lewes was the second son&nbsp;<span>of George Henry Lewes and Agnes Jarvis Lewes.&nbsp;</span>Thornie was named after Lewes's close friend (and Agnes's longtime lover), Thornton Hunt. He attended a day school in Bayswater until 1856, when, at the age of 12, he was sent with his older brother Charles to an international boarding school near Berne, Switzerland. His father was trying to shield his sons from the scandal caused by Agnes's and his own irregular living arrangements.<br /><span></span></p>
<p><span>Lewes finally introduced his sons to George Eliot in 1860, after she had achieved critical and popular success with <em>Adam Bede.&nbsp;</em></span>The boys knew of their mother's atypical living arrangements, and found a maternal figure in George Eliot. <span>Thornie affectionately called her&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;'Mutter' until he died.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In 1863, Thornie failed his Civil Service exam at Edinburgh. Rather than re-sit the exam, he instead went to Natal, Africa, to try farming. His brother Herbert 'Bertie' joined him not long after. The two eked out a living learning to farm, hunt, and barter &nbsp;with the locals until 1869, when Thornie wrote to his father that he was seriously ill. Thornie returned to England, where he was nursed by his father and George Eliot through a painful summer.

"Lewis, Maria (1800-1887)","<p>George Eliot's former teacher, Maria Lewis, was a crucial role model for Eliot growing up. When Eliot was sent to Lewis's school in Nuneaton, she was drawn to Lewis for approval, affection, and guidance. These feelings were intensified after Eliot's mother's death in 1836.</p>
<p>The two corresponded faithfully after Eliot left the school and Maria was usually spent her holidays with Eliot and her father in their Coventry home. <span>Lewis's Evangelical Christian beliefs had for many years influenced Eliot's; by 1841, however, Eliot had begun to question and doubt. In January 1842, Eliot&nbsp;</span>refused to attend church with Maria and her father, which started &nbsp;what Eliot later called a 'holy war.' This act caused a rift with Maria, which was not resolved until 1874, when Eliot learned Lewis's address and began sending her a yearly gift of money. Lewis's pride in her student was evident in her letters, where she claimed to know Eliot more intimately than any other.</p>",
"Liggins, Joseph (1800-1872)","Joseph Liggins was believed by some to be the true identity behind the pen name 'George Eliot' when <em>Scenes of Clerical Life</em> was published in 1857. Residents of Nuneaton and the surrounding areas recognized the characters and stories as pieces of local history. Liggins, a poor journalist, was the only local writer they thought they knew. Liggins allowed his friends to think he'd authored <em>Scenes of Clericsl Life</em> and <em>Adam Bede</em> and that he was being cheated out of the royalties owed him by the books' publisher, Blackwood and Sons. The scandal over Liggins's supposed authorship was part of the reason Eliot finally revealed her identity to her friends after maintaining her anonymity for three years.",

Sara stayed regularly with her sister at Rosehill, where she eventually met George Eliot. Both women were intellectuals and the two quickly became close friends, though Sara tended to focus more on theology, which Eliot had left behind. Hennell aided Eliot in her earlier translation of <i>Das Leben Jesu </i>(<em>The Life of Jesus</em>). While Hennell disapproved of Eliot's choice in being with George Henry Lewes, Sara still wrote letters proclaiming her love. She did have issues with Lewes himself, who intervened in Eliot and Hennell's correspondence and even sometimes claimed to have lost letters. Despite difficulties, Hennell and Eliot remained longtime friends; even after the rift caused by Eliot's romantic relationship, the two still traded many letters throughout the years.","I, x, xlvi, account of, Jvi-lviii; 120, 156, sees Strauss, I 76; 180, governess for Bonham Carters, 181, II, 39, IV, 439, VII, 62; I, 182,192, 203, 219, atRosehill, 223; meets Eliza Lynn, 225; 227, 241, meets Emerson, 256; 264, at Rosehill while Brays are abroad, 285; 303, 313, 318, idolizes brother, 320; 323, 330, 334-5, wins Baillie Prizes, I, 343, II, 259, 282, III, 329, 372; at 142 Strand, I, 345, II, 12; 14, moves to Ivy Cottage, Coventry, 62; teaches Frank and Nelly, 221; Women's Rights, 227, IV, 390; II, 229, 261, sends GE her portrait, 276; Brays move into Ivy Cottage with, 302, 314; on Isaac: Taylor, 305; takes Nelly Bray toWales, 376; proposed paper for WR rejected, 482, 489; verses on Bu4Ie,. 485-6; 5ll, at Ravensbourne, III, 36:';¬∑ moves to Barr's Hill Terrace, 444 -,5;' 456, 467, IV, 9, investment in ChaP,: man's business, IO-I; 82, 87, photo un:like her, 90; 106, ll2, at Lea Hu t 118;120,149,155,recommends Hay;;¬∑rogate, 162; 163-5, 312, 363, income. duced, 374; V, 54, visits John Si 56; getsout 3d ed. of Hennell's J,i,l, quiry, 95; 97, Ill, 114Autographs II, 25, 94, GE sends Sara letters Arnott,213;E.Blackwell,III‚Ä¢,7t1C.

"Hennell, Charles Christian (1809-1850)","Charles Christian Hennell is regarded as a major influence of George Eliot‚Äôs early maturity, and his historical account of the Bible,<em> Inquiry Concerning the Origin of Christianity</em> (1838), influenced Eliot's faltering belief in Christianity that culminated in her refusal to attend church with her father in 1842. Hennell believed the Bible was partly true, but mingled with fiction, a view she accepted, especially as she began translating D. F. Straus‚Äôs <em>The Life of Jesus </em>(1846) and Ludwig Feuerbach‚Äôs <em>The Essence of Christianity</em> (1854). Hennell‚Äôs influence, wisdom, perspective, and analyses of historical facts were congenial to Eliot's questioning of Christian orthodoxy, particularly her&nbsp; doubts about the supernatural elements in the Gospel stories of Christ‚Äôs life. Charles Hennell was the brother of Sara Hennell and Cara Hennell Bray, and in 1843, he married her close friend, Rufa Brabant.","Portrait of Charles Christian Hennell ,Nuneaton Museum and Art Gallery, England"

"Evans, Robert (1773-1849)","Eliot's father Robert Evans was the fourth son of a carpenter. After basic schooling, he was apprenticed to his father's trade and then set up a carpentry business. A local landowner, Francis Parker noticed his ability and invited him in 1802 to manage an estate he had inherited in Derbyshire. In 1806, after the death of Sir Roger Newdigate, Francis Parker inherited the Arbury estate near Nuneaton in Warwickshire and once again asked Evans to manage it. This began a long career in estate management, where Evans earned the reputation of being fair, honest, and hard working.<br /><br />Evans married twice. His first wife was a servant of the Parker family, Harriet Poynton, who had two children and died giving birth to a third in 1809. Evans remarried to a farmer's daughter, Christiana, who gave birth to three children: Christiana 'Chrissey', Isaac, and Mary Ann (the future George Eliot). She also gave birth to twin boys in 1821 who did not survive childbirth. Eliot was apparently much closer to her father than to her mother, about whom she writes almost nothing.<br /><br />When Christiana died, Eliot took over much of the domestic work in the house and became indispensable to her father. Evans encouraged Eliot's intellectual development and paid for tutors in German and Italian. Eventually, Evans retired and his son Isaac took over the estate management in 1841. Evans and Eliot moved to Coventry, where a dispute soon arose after Eliot began interacting with the radical Brays. Evans, who benefited from the support of the upper class in his life, was a staunch conservative. Eventually, Eliot announced that she could no longer believe in Christianity and refused to accompany him to church, which infuriated her father. It took several weeks and an intervention from Isaac to mend the rift. Evans' health began to decline in 1845, and for the next four years as his health declined, Eliot devoted herself to caring for him. He passed away in 1849. The experience left a strong impression on Eliot, whose fiction frequently includes scenes of tending loved ones at the time of their deaths.","4:130, 4:140, 4:299, 4:306

"Evans, Isaac Pearson (1816-1890)","Older than his sister by three years, Isaac Evans was quite close to George Eliot when they were children but grew apart as he became more conservative and she more radical. Isaac and Eliot spent their childhood as constant companions until being sent to separate boarding schools. While aging and separation did cause some distance, the two remained on good terms while they both lived in the Warwickshire country of their upbringing. When Eliot was still living with her father in Coventry, Isaac and his wife, Sarah, offered their own house for her to stay in despite a previous falling out over Eliot's refusal to attend church. After their father retired, Isaac Evans took over the family business of estate management and also seemed to take on some of his social expectations.<br /><br />Eliot avoided telling her family of her relationship with George Henry Lewes for three years; when she did finally tell Isaac in 1857 that she had a 'husband,' her brother quickly found out the truth--that she was living with an already-married man. Consequently, he cut off all communication with her and demanded their sisters Fanny and Chrissey do the same. Evans did not speak to his sister for 23 years, though his wife did send condolences to Eliot when Lewes died. The silence was not broken until Evans heard of Eliot's marriage to John Cross, where he wrote to her with congratulations. The two exchanged letters, saying they were still fond of each other even after the long separation. Before they could be reunited in person, Eliot unexpectedly died. Evans seemed to feel true sorrow, to the extent that he made the difficult trek during winter to attend her funeral in London.

However, Cross suffered from bouts of depression and, while in Venice, according to police reports, threw himself from the window of their hotel into the Grand Canal. He was rescued by gondoliers and with the help of his older brother, whom Eliot had summoned to Venice following the crisis, was able to return to England and to the marriage as if nothing of consequence had happened. A mere seven months after they wed, George Eliot died unexpectedly of kidney failure in December 1880. Cross did his duty by completing George Eliot's biography and then went on to write some articles that were decently received. John Cross never remarried; he died after a long widowerhood at age 84.","1:lxiii, 5:302, 5:310, 5:4366:154, 6:170, 6:3607:16

"Congreve, Maria Bury (1846-1915)","Maria Bury Congreve's father, Dr. Bury, was George Eliot's family physician and was the reason they met in their youth. They met again years later as neighbors in Wandsworth in 1859, when their husbands became acquainted. They remained good friends for several decades, up until Eliot's death. Maria and her husband, Richard Congreve, were attempting to establish a Positivist church in London. <br />The couple became two of the few people Eliot told about her fiction writing career before others uncovered the secret. Richard, who was a doctor, became an invaluable source of information while Eliot was writing Lydgate's story in <i>Middlemarch</i>. However, because of their Positivist prejudices against remarriage, Eliot did not confide to the couple of her impending marriage to Cross. In response to a short letter from Maria on the eve of the wedding, Eliot responded with a promise that Charles Lewes would explain 'a great, momentous change' that was coming: her marriage to John Cross. Eliot remained close to the couple for years after.

"Combe, George (1788-1858)","A phrenologist with interests in penal reform and education, George Combe met George Eliot in Charles Bray's home in 1851, during which he examined her head, proclaiming her to be extraordinary. He noted that she had looked 40 when in fact she was 32 and remarked on her delicate health, but felt that she had 'great analytic power and an instinctive soundness of judgment,' and that she appeared to be the ablest woman he had ever seen. His assessment revealed that she had a very large brain, noting the anterior lobe's large dimensions. Upon learning of Eliot's relationship with a married George Henry Lewes, Combe was horrified that his readings of her skull could have been so wrong. In strained letters to Bray, Combe suspected insanity in Eliot's family, which could only explain such a behavior.","1:193, 1:232, 1:352, 1:359, 1:361, 1:365, 1:369,1:372, 1:3742:12; 2:17, 2:22; 2:23, 2:31, 2:33, 2:37, 2:39, 2:43, 2:48, 2:49, 2:54, 2:56, 2:58, 2:59-62; 2:72, (80, 82, 83?), 2:98; 2:102; 2:104-6, 2:108; 2:113, 2:116, 2:117; 2:135, 2:137, 2:155;2:162, 2:183, 2:210, 2:214; 2:219, 2:222, 2:257, 2:264; 2:4793:1695:322 "

The couple was plagued with economic problems after their marriage. Over the next 15 years, she would give birth to nine children, and five died in childhood. Eliot's character Gritty Tulliver Moss in <em>The Mill on the Floss</em> may be loosely based on her sister, Chrissey.<br /><br />Chrissey's husband, Edward Clarke ran a medical practice in a small town and struggled to make a living. When he died in 1852, he left Chrissey in a difficult financial position that drove her to seek help from her family. Eliot sent money to Chrissey many times, and cared deeply for her and her children. When Eliot revealed her relationship with George Henry Lewes, Chrissey and her half-sister Fanny followed strict orders from their brother Issac and stopped writing to their sister.

This betrayal drew the ire of Lewes and others who had gone to great lengths to protect Eliot's identity from a biased and harshly judgmental public.","1:XI, 1:XIV, 1:XV, 1:XLIV, I:XLV, 1:LIV, 1:LVII, 1:LIX-LXI, 1:LXX, 1:LXXV, 1:175, 1:196, 1:212, 1:214, 1:224, 1:225, 1:227, 1:231, 1:232, 1:256, 1:280, 1:299, 1:306, 1:321, 1:332, 1:334-5, 1:337, 1:338, 1:341, 1:342, 1:343, 1:344, 1:345, 1:346, 1:346-7, 1:348, 1:349, 1:350, 1:351, 1:351-3, 1:353, 1:354, 1:354-6, 1:359, 1:360-1, 1:363, 1:364, 1:366, 1:369, 1:370, 1:371, 1:372, 1:373, 1:374, 1:375, 1:376, 1:3782:3, 2:4, 2:6, 2:7, 2:8, 2:9 2:11, 2:14, 2:17, 2:21, 2:21-2, 2:24, 2:29, 2:31, 2:35, 2:36, 2:38, 2:39, 2:40, 2:43, 2:44, 2:45, 2:46, 2:48, 2:50, 2:51, 2:53, 2:53-4, 2:54, 2:55, 2:57, 2:62, 2:63, 2:65-6, 2:67, 2:68, 2:70, 2:70-1, 2:72, 2:79, 2:80, 2:82, 2:82-3, 2:83, 2:84, 2:89, 2:90, 2:92, 2:93, 2:95, 2:98, 2:99, 2:100, 2:101, 2:107, 2:108, 2:109, 2:118, 2:119, 2:120, 2:122, 2:123, 2:127, 2:127-8, 2:128, 2:130, 2:132, 2:133, 2:137, 2:141, 2:143, 2:147, 2:151, 2:152, 2:157, 2:162, 2:163, 2:164, 2:165, 2:172, 2:174, 2:175, 2:179, 2:180, 2:181-2, 2:183, 2:187, 2:188, 2:189, 2:191, 2:196, 2:197, 2:198, 2:200, 2:201, 2:205, 2:205-9, 2:217, 2:220, 2:225, 2:232, 2:238, 2:254?, 2:25 2:257-8, 2:259, 2:261, 2:271, 2:287-8, 2:288, 2:289, 2:290, 2:351, 2:377, 2:382-3, 2:385, 2:397-8, 2:401, 2:420-1, 2:426-7, 2:431, 2:438, 2:456, 2:471, 2:472-3, 2:482, 2:485, 2:471, 2:485, 2:486, 2:489, 2:490, 2:494, 2:5053:3-4, 3:7, 3:12-3, 3:49, 3:71, 3:238, 3:254?, 3:310, 3:3294:8, 4:10, 4:10-1, 4:11, 4:18, 4:21, 4:23, 4:26, 4:228-9, 4:238, 4:260, 4:385"
"Carlyle, Thomas (1795-1881)","Thomas Carlyle authored many historical and philosophical texts, many of which George Eliot read. As Eliot began to publish, her ideologies created disagreements with Carlyle. While he was originally a mentor to George Henry Lewes, and the person to whom Lewes dedicated his Goethe biography, Carlyle strongly disagreed with Lewes' relationship with Eliot. Lewes wrote him a long letter of explanation after the scandal broke in England that he was living abroad with the unmarried George Eliot, which seemed to partially but incompletely heal their wounded friendship. Carlyle married Jane Welsh Carlyle in 1826. Their marriage was notoriously unhappy, and Carlyle never brought his wife to visit Eliot and Lewes, yet Jane valued Eliot's works and was a supporter of her nonetheless.","1:XLIII, 1:LIX, 1:71, 1:122, 1:162, 1:171, 1:225-3(?), 1:271, 1:272, 1:274, 1:345, 1:361, 1:366, 1:369-70, 1:371, 1:373, 1:376, 1:3782:23, 2:69, 2:92; 2:114, 2:139, 2:143, 2:176-9, 2:185; 2:238, 2:295; 2:330, 2:358; 2:412, 2:415; 2:425-6, 2:4413:7-9, 3:20, 3:23, 3:37, 3:102, 3:435, 3:4504:65, 4:203, 4:290, 4:4695:49, 5:117, 5:4226:60"

While her husband contended that he could not complete any of Eliot's novels and had a complicated relationship to the ideas present in Eliot's work, Jane remained a staunch supporter. Thomas Carlyle's friendship with Lewes was also hindered after he began living with George Eliot. <br />Eliot sent a copy of <em>Scenes of Clerical Life</em> not to Thomas, but to Jane, who was delighted to receive it.

Eliot described him as an ‚Äúagreeable man with a little English glazing shyness‚Äù (GEL8: 480). In the summer of 1864, Burton made several sketches of George Eliot in preparation for a finished chalk portrait, completed in 1865 and exhibited at the Royal Academy. It was one of the few images of Eliot that she and Lewes liked. Lewes hung the portrait over the mantle in their home, the Priory and, along with Eliot‚Äôs bound and inscribed manuscripts, was remembered by guests who were honored with a tour of the home.

After his wife‚Äôs early death in 1861, he returned to England where his own reputation grew as bright as hers had been. George Eliot strongly preferred the poetry of Elizabeth Barret Browning, especially <em>Aurora Leigh</em> (1857), over Robert Browning‚Äôs writings, and wished she could have met her (GEL2: 278). Eliot met Robert Browning, who made his first visit to the Priory in 1862 for one of their Sunday afternoon salons and returned occasionally, including a visit in 1865, after which Lewes and Eliot followed Browning home to see the chair, table, and books that had been his wife‚Äôs (GEL4: 205).

"Browning, Oscar (1837-1923)","Oscar Browning was a schoolmaster at Eton and a historian when he met George Henry Lewes and George Eliot in 1866. Browning was apparently pleased with his place in Lewes' and Eliot's crowd, which was dotted with celebrities. In 1875, Browning was dismissed as schoolmaster at Eton for rumors of homosexual advances. He returned to Cambridge where he strove to advance the study of history at the university and wrote historical works in his retirement. Browning wrote <em>The Life of George Eliot</em> in 1890, which brought together details from John Walter Cross‚Äôs biography and Browning's own personal interactions with Eliot. According to Henry James in a letter to his sister Alice in 1881, Browning had a theory that Eliot discovered something unsavory in Lewes' notes after his death and desired to go back on Lewes.

"Bodichon, Barbara Leigh Smith (1827-1891)","George Eliot's closest friend after moving to London, Barbara Bodichon, nee Leigh Smith, was a feminist activist who strove for women‚Äôs education and enfranchisement. Bodichon's parents were not married, which isolated Bodichon socially. After Eliot began living unmarried with Lewes, Bodichon became an especially close friend, one who could sympathize with social shunning. Eliot supported Bodichon in many of her political acts, including petitioning parliament to pass a Married Women's Property Bill to protect married women‚Äôs earnings. Both women had been involved with the married John Chapman, who attempted to convince Bodichon to have a sexual relationship with him, using Lewes and Eliot‚Äôs unsanctioned domestic partnership as a positive example. <br />In 1857, Bodichon married a French doctor and lived abroad in Algiers half the year. Barbara Bodichon was the first to recognize Eliot's <i>Adam Bede</i> as the work of her friend, which delighted the author. Along with Emily Davies, Bodichon founded Girton College, Cambridge, the first university open to women, which Eliot supported with a modest financial donation. After Bodichon suffered from a stroke in 1877, she left to live in Sussex and the women rarely saw one another after that. Although Bodichon was surprised to read of Eliot's marriage to John Cross, she heartily wished them well. She was one of the last people Eliot wrote to before her death.","1:XII, 1:XVIII, 1:XLIV, 1:XLVIII, 1:LIII-LV2:9, 2:13, 2:16, 2:30, 2:32, 2:40, 2:45, 2:65, 2:87, 2:106, 2:109, 2:144-5, 2:145, 2:165, 2:174, 2:196, 2:211, 2:225-7, 2:229, 2:254-5, 2:255, 2:257, 2:267, 2:320, 2:337, 2:345, 2:352, 2:361; 2:338, 2:341, 2:3513:56-7, 3:59, 3:61, 3:64-5, 3:66, 3:79, 3:88, 3:99, 3:102, 3:104, 3:107, 3:108, 3:119, 3:123, 3:124, 3:128, 3:134, 3:142, 3:157, 3:169, 3:172, 3:224-6, 3:269-71, 3:309-10, 3:311, 3:317, 3:331, 3:333, 3:334, 3:337, 3:342-3, 3:365-7, 3:388-9, 3:402, 3:403, 3:413, 3:442, 3:439, 3:444, 3:446, 3:447, 3:455, 3:4664:14, 4:20-1, 4:23, 4:30, 4:45, 4:64, 4:84, 4:92, 4:101, 4:107, 4:109, 4:115-20, 4:125, 4:131-2, 4:140-3, 4:143, 4:146, 4:167, 4:195, 4:198, 4:236-7, 4:266, 4:328, 4:329, 4:338-9, 4:351, 4:362, 4:367, 4:377-8, 4:379, 4:383, 4:396, 4:399, 4:401, 4:413, 4:425, 4:428, 4:430, 4:475-6, 4:483, 4:487, 4:493, 4:4955:3, 5:13, 5:19, 5:34, 5:35-6, 5:44-5, 5:46, 5:57, 5:68, 5:70, 5:73, 5:74, 5:77, 5:78, 5:104-5, 5:113, 5:117, 5:123, 5:125, 5:126, 5:12"

"Tennyson, Alfred (1809-1892)",The famous poet Alfred Tennyson was introduced to George Eliot in 1858 and kept a close professional relationship with her for many years after.

Anthony Trollope also was employed at the Post Office in London, where, in 1860, he was able to secure a position for Lewes‚Äôs eldest son, Charles.

"Tyndall, John (1820-1893)","A physicist at the Royal Institution, John Tyndall belonged to George Henry Lewes' and George Eliot's circle of distinguished friends. Tyndall may have inspired the candle parable in <i>Middlemarch </i>with his research on light and optical illusions. After Eliot's death, Tyndall wrote to the Dean of Westminster to support Eliot's proposed burial in Westminster Abbey, saying, ‚Äú[Eliot] is a woman whose achievements were without parallel in the previous history of womankind‚Äù (Haight 549).",

"White, William Hale (1831-1919)","Writing under the pen name Mark Rutherford, William Hale White wrote of George Eliot as he knew her when they both boarded at John Chapman's house at 142 Strand in London. White worked with Eliot on the <em>Westminster Review</em> and lost touch with her after moving out of Chapman‚Äôs boarding house, something he later regretted. Attempting to reconnect with Eliot years later, White wrote to her, but his letter was answered dismissively by George Henry Lewes. It is possible that White was in love with Eliot; in his partially-fictionalized autobiography, <em>The Autobiography of Mark Rutherford: Dissenting Minister </em>(1881), he depicts a romantic figure named Theresa who is clearly modelled after George Eliot.","1:XV, 6:248, 6:278 "
