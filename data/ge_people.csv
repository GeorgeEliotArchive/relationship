Eventually, the Brays reunited with Eliot and they remained fast friends until her death.",,,,,"51, 64","37, 39",,,"account  of, I,  lv-lix;  lxxv, 158, 164, 183, 187, 190-1, 19!1-4, 197, 201, 207-8, 2ll,  214,  has  cholera,  223;  buys  Cov; entry Herald, 224; 229, 231, 236, 243,266-8,  284-5,  304,  328,  344,  346, 348, 350,  354,  357,  359,  362-4,  370,    374, birthday,  II,  8;  10.:.I, 13-4,  17,  22, 29- 30,  35,  43,  57,  84,  92-7,  102-3,   110, 128,  144-7,  wedding  anniversary,  153; 155, 160, 164-5, 187, 191, 203, 205, 209, 2ll, 230, sells Rosehill, 234; 256, 264-5,284,  301,  moves  to  Ivy  Cottage,   302, 314;  320,  329, goes  to  Handel Festival,  338-9,  Mrs.  Cash  on,  340;  388-9, 412, 415, 423, 483, 486, III, 16, 27, 71,  plans joke  book,  136,  214,  241,  builds  house at  Sydenham,  3II,  IV,  87;    III,    322,  338,  leaves  Ivy  Cottage  for  Barr's  Hill Terrace,  Coventry,  445;  467, 469, IV, 77-8, 90-1, 125, 136, 147, 149, 157,  159, 169,  184, 193, 198,  210,  213,  232, 268, 296, 298, 314, 356, lets Coventry  house,  360, 363; 4ll, V, 9, 54-5, II5,   131-2,217,  226,  232,  279,  433,  472,  asthma, VI,  92, 94,  VII,  37;  VI, 192,  283, sells  Ivy Cottage, 352; 419, VII, 62, 124,   341 GE and Charles Bray I,   xlix,   GE   meets,   120;   reads   his Philosophy  of  Necessity, I,  124;  Bray makes  phrenological  readings  of  GE, 126, 265; 154, takes  GE  to  Tenby, 160, to  London  for  Rufa's  wedding,  163,  to Lakes, 178; 167, 175, has cast made of  GE's  head, 178;  180, 195,  takes  GE  to Scotland,   199-200,   to  London,  232; 283-4,   takes   GE   abroad,   289;  sends passport,  292:  307,  310,  sends  Herald, 315;  324,  GE  lives  at  Rosehill,  336 -7; 342,  gives  up  his  study  to  GE,  355; takes GE  to London, 365; 366 -7,  373, II,  34,  39-40,  44,  46,  comes  to Broad- stairs,  50;  56,  61,  73,  walks    to    station to  see  GE,  79;  sends Herald, 80;  GE's affection  for,  81-2;  helps  GE  move,  83; GE  recuperates  at  Rosehill,    99;    II5,  ll7,  ll9,  sends  GE  bookcase,  122,  125; 140, 148, sees GEin London, 158; spends day  with  GE,  161;  advancesÙ„  money  to GE,  165, 184;  GE  writes  from  Weimar, 170;  GE  confided  facts  of  her  relation  to  GHL  only  to  Bray  and  Chapman, 179,  181-2,  183,  VII,  387;  advises GE on  business,  II,  197:  warned  not  to  mis - quote    GE's    remark    on    GHL,    199;  lends  Scott's  novels,    201,    215;    visits GE,  204;  guesses  authorship  of  'Cum- ming'   article,   218;   GE   gives   GHL's Goethe to,  221;  invites  GE  to  stop  at Rosehill,  224;    GE    offershim    a    bed, 234; 237, 252, 259-60, visits GE,   261-2,269; GE refuses to visit Rosehill, 279; visits GE at Richmond, 287; 306, sus- pects GE of writing a novel, 443; 490, 505,  sends  GE  oysters,  510;  5ll,  III, 87,  GE  reveals  incognito  to, 90; 91, GE gives Bray Scenes and Adam, 121; calls  R.

After basic schooling, he was apprenticed to his father's trade and then set up a carpentry business. A local landowner, Francis Parker noticed his ability and invited him in 1802 to manage an estate he had inherited in Derbyshire. In 1806, after the death of Sir Roger Newdigate, Francis Parker inherited the Arbury estate near Nuneaton in Warwickshire and once again asked Evans to manage it. This began a long career in estate management, where Evans earned the reputation of being fair, honest, and hard working.<br /><br />Evans married twice. His first wife was a servant of the Parker family, Harriet Poynton, who had two children and died giving birth to a third in 1809. Evans remarried to a farmer's daughter, Christiana, who gave birth to three children: Christiana 'Chrissey', Isaac, and Mary Ann (the future George Eliot). She also gave birth to twin boys in 1821 who did not survive childbirth. Eliot was apparently much closer to her father than to her mother, about whom she writes almost nothing.<br /><br />When Christiana died, Eliot took over much of the domestic work in the house and became indispensable to her father. Evans encouraged Eliot's intellectual development and paid for tutors in German and Italian. Eventually, Evans retired and his son Isaac took over the estate management in 1841. Evans and Eliot moved to Coventry, where a dispute soon arose after Eliot began interacting with the radical Brays. Evans, who benefited from the support of the upper class in his life, was a staunch conservative. Eventually, Eliot announced that she could no longer believe in Christianity and refused to accompany him to church, which infuriated her father. It took several weeks and an intervention from Isaac to mend the rift. Evans' health began to decline in 1845, and for the next four years as his health declined, Eliot devoted herself to caring for him. He passed away in 1849. The experience left a strong impression on Eliot, whose fiction frequently includes scenes of tending loved ones at the time of their deaths.","Eliot's father Robert Evans was the fourth son of a carpenter.

Evans remarried to a farmer's daughter, Christiana, who gave birth to three children: Christiana 'Chrissey', Isaac, and Mary Ann (the future George Eliot). She also gave birth to twin boys in 1821 who did not survive childbirth. Eliot was apparently much closer to her father than to her mother, about whom she writes almost nothing.<br /><br />When Christiana died, Eliot took over much of the domestic work in the house and became indispensable to her father. Evans encouraged Eliot's intellectual development and paid for tutors in German and Italian. Eventually, Evans retired and his son Isaac took over the estate management in 1841. Evans and Eliot moved to Coventry, where a dispute soon arose after Eliot began interacting with the radical Brays. Evans, who benefited from the support of the upper class in his life, was a staunch conservative. Eventually, Eliot announced that she could no longer believe in Christianity and refused to accompany him to church, which infuriated her father. It took several weeks and an intervention from Isaac to mend the rift. Evans' health began to decline in 1845, and for the next four years as his health declined, Eliot devoted herself to caring for him. He passed away in 1849. The experience left a strong impression on Eliot, whose fiction frequently includes scenes of tending loved ones at the time of their deaths.",,,,,,,,,,

Huxley coined the term ÒagnosticÓ to describe his own position regarding religion, which closely corresponded with EliotÕs views.</p>

1854 until his death in 1878. Though little is known of his childhood, Lewes appears to have grown up plagued with financial problems and an unstable family unit. He found work as a clerk, and eventually attempted to break into the literary scene with a biography of Percy Bysshe Shelley. After meeting Shelley's friend Leigh Hunt, he hoped to forge a personal connection with Shelley's widow, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. Unfortunately for Lewes, Shelley's widow would not support the proposed biography. While the biography did not come to fruition, Leigh Hunt and his son Thornton Hunt remained a part of Lewes's life. <br /><br />Lewes's wife, Agnes, birthed three children to Lewes (Charles, Thornton, and Herbert), but by the late 1840s, their domestic relationship was withering. Because of his own beliefs in free sexual relations, probably borrowed from Shelley, Lewes allowed and perhaps even approved when Thornton Hunt began a sexual relationship with Agnes, which produced the first of four children in 1850. Lewes signed his name to the birth certificates for even Hunt's children, which made divorce options complicated if not impossible later on. <br /><br />While Lewes became successful in his writing endeavors, he fell into a great depression because of his domestic life. Even as he garnered praise for his works, including his popular <i>A Biographical History of Philosophy</i> and his many articles written for various magazines, Lewes did not recover from his depression until he met George Eliot through a common friend, Herbert Spencer. The two became lovers, perhaps as early as 1853, and by July 1854, when Lewes and Eliot traveled to Germany together and stayed on the continent for nearly 8 months, they had established themselves as a couple. Lewes went to Germany to conduct research for his <em>Life of Goethe</em>, while Eliot ostensibly joined him to provide German-to-English translation assistance. As it turned out, Lewes's <em>Life of Goethe</em>, which never mentions Eliot, not only enjoyed several reprintings during Lewes's lifetime but also was his most successful work. Lewes turned to more scientific articles after his Goethe biography, including a series of articles (later collected in book form) on marine life written while he and Eliot travelled to the English and Welsh coasts. Lewes sent his two elder sons to boarding school on the continent, possibly to save them from the gossip that plagued Lewes and Eliot in England. It took Lewes three years to reveal to his sons the fact of his relationship with Eliot. Thrilled to learn she was the celebrity author of <i>Adam Bede</i>, the boys accepted her and eventually would call her 'Mutter.'<br /><br />It was Lewes's support that encouraged Eliot to begin writing fiction. From the beginning, Lewes acted as an intermediary between Eliot and her publishers. While their relationship undoubtedly was vital in motivating George Eliot, some critics question Lewes's methods of isolating her from negative feedback. However, Lewes evidently found pleasure rather than jealousy in her success and wrote adoringly of her in letters to friends. <br /><br />In his later years, Lewes became editor to several important magazines, including the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> in 1862 and the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> in 1865. Two of his children moved to Africa in this period to farm, though his son Thornton, 'Thornie,' moved back in 1869 after contracting spinal meningitis. Lewes and Eliot nursed him until his death in that year. Herbert, 'Bertie,' his youngest son died also, of tuberculosis, in Africa before he could return to England. At the end of his life, Lewes strove to complete his 5-volume magnum opus, <i>Problems of Life and Mind,</i> that combined physiology and psychology. The final two volumes would have remained unfinished had Eliot not picked up the pen after Lewes's death.
